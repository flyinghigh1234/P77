    <p> To set up Visual Studio Code, you first have to download the app. Then, you need to create an empty folder on
        your device. After that stage, drag and drop that folder onto the front page of Visual Studio Code and start
        coding!!!

        The console screen is used to alert you if there are any mistake, or things just don't make sense in your code.
        If you want to print anything onto the console, first type console.log, and then, with out a space, add a pair
        of brackets, and inside them, type in whatever you want to be printed onto the console.
